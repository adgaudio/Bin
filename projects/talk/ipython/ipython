My talk will talk about IPython for Software Development and shell integration.  This talk will explore several, but by no means all, features of IPython.  Specifically, I hope to get everyone here jump started into using an amazing interactive computing tool.  Unfortunately, we will not review IPython's cool parallel computing capabilities, and I will gloss over a lot of features and details due to time constraints 



Main Features for daily use
    The purpose of this section is just to give a broad overview of what's immediately available at your disposal for general ipython use.  We will go into details later.

    1. Tab Completion
    2. Object exploration with %psearch ; ? or %pdoc (ie  foobar = 1 ; *oo*?  ) ; ?? or %psource; %pfile; %who; %whos...
    3. Magic Functions: %lsmagic and %magic?
        There are a lot of useful magic functions, and we will only have time to explore some of them.
        - %history, %run, %edit, %cd
        - general use/miscellaneous: %reset, %timeit, %paste, %autocall and /, %autoquote and , or ;
        - define your own magic: a = get_ipython() ; a.define_magic('name', function)
    4. Customized configuration and Profiles:  this is new since July
        - Built from scratch, heavily based off of Enthought traitlets, pure python
        - Can be very simple or really complicated, as you choose.  Everything can be configured.
            - from interpreter: get_ipython()
            - from config file: config/ipython/profile_default2 (example from enthought)
            - IPython exposes all configurable options on the command-line
            - 4 main concepts: Configuration Object, Application (applies Config object to Configurables), Configurable (implements Application's logic), SingletonConfigurable (only 1 instance - lets us connect into an Application instance)
            - Extensions: advanced config that gives access to the running IPython instance
                - Plugins: extensions load plugins which add new capabilities
    5. History
        - %pushd, %popd, %dhist, %cd (!cd won't work)
        - _, __, and ___, _ih, _oh, %hist -g <regexp>
        - retains input in a database.  logs session input. search sessions.
        - advanced history example:  a = get_ipython.history_manager ; a.search("zip*")
Use Cases:
    In this section, we will use IPython to accomplish some basic tasks.  Each successive subsection will show a few more IPython features, run through examples, and demo something that takes a little configuration or extra effort, or something that just doesn't work yet.

    1. As System shell
        - %sx or ! or !!
            - create a file and  !tail the file
            - a = !tail    or    !!tail ; _
            - b='from ipython' ; c = ' and me'
              !echo 'hello $b'
              !echo 'hello ${b + c}'
        - %alias - magic functions that are system shell cmds
            - %rehashx - not that this doesn't mess up your namespace :)
            - a = get_ipython() ; a.alias_manager.define_alias('laaa', 'ls %s')
        - SList grep, fields, sort, .l, .n, .p (path manipulations!)
            - a = !ls -l
            - a.fields() ; a.grep(r'^d').fields(-1).p ... !!!
        - exercise1: Use above cmds to ls -l // !echo show table status|mysql -uroot
            - get field, get abs path, get table names and size?  
            - We can do plotting with this, which we will see later
        - exercise2: port .bashrc aliases into ipython

    2. Code Development and Debugging
        - %macro (make a macro from above code. use it, then turn it into a script)
        - Show different workflow possibilities 
        - %edit (-p, ) (go over options and show example usage)
        - %run  (go over options and show example usage): run -p, run -d
        - %pdb, %xmode (changes way tracebacks appear)
        - embedding ipython
        - %doctest_mode

        - Vim integration? currently broken, but ipython install ships with ipython.vim plugin somewhere in your filesystem...
        - multidb example

    3. Interactive data exploration
        - IPython.embed() (example of data exploration)
            - Lets you see code in its own namespace, so changes to variables won't affect program execution
            - A view on data, plots, functions, etc
        - %gui, ipython --pylab=['tk', 'qt', 'wx', 'gtk', 'osx'], ipython-qtconsole
        - %pylab, plot()
    
        - python-qtconsole --pylab=inline- Gui Integration for and visualization/plotting capabilities
            - %loadpy, custom fonts, pictures
        - pandas!!!??? TODO: can I pipe output from my multidb_query.py into pandas?
    6. Parallel Computing???

IPython USE CASES:
1. A better Python shell: object introspection, system access, ’magic’ command system, configurable/customizable

   Magic functions: the '%' prefix

   Introspection, Exploration, Coding:
       %prun   --> proﬁle single Python expressions (like function calls)	    
       %xmode
       %pdb and %debug
       %edit
       %dreload - recursive reload, doesn't always work

   History:
       %hist
       Output: stored in the global variables, Out and _N (ie Out[4] == _4). Also, _, __, and ___ keep the last three results.
       Input: stored in the global variable, In.
       %logstart, %logon/off, %runlog (for ignoring errors.  %run also works, but fails on errors)
       %cd, %dhist, %popd, %pushd, %bookmark  --> directory history: change dir, manage dir stacks, bookmark a location

   Other goodies:
       %macro mymacro 1:4 6 #turns first 4 lines and the 6th line of history into a callable function
        macro mymacro 
           %edit mymacro # just brilliant.

       %

       %autocall # Automatically add parentheses 
       %autoquotes
ipython -pylab --> interactive matplotlib integration



2. An embeddable interpreter: for debugging and for mixing batch-processing interactively
	    DEMO: embed_ipython.py and embed_ipython2.py

3. A ﬂexible framework: you can use it as the base environment for other systems with
Python as the underlying language. It is very conﬁgurable in this direction.
4. A system for interactive control of distributed/parallel computing systems: next talk.
5. An interactive component we can plug into GUIs, browser-based shells, etc
6. Fun Utility modules:
   PyColorize:
       from ipython, call:  myfile = file('SOMECODE.py').read() ; import IPython.PyColorize as p ; p.Parser().format(myfile)
   Demo:
       from IPython import demo ; demo.Demo('embed_ipython.py')
