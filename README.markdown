This repo contains some useful tools and mini projects.

Mini projects:

* Config - other less used and unimportant files.

* **Markov Chains** - for random sequence generation.  Works on input split by space or by character, depending on how you configure it

* **spf13-vim** - My fork of spf13's vim project.  I use the python branch and provide an install and update script useful to anyone forking spf13's project.

* **Tmux** - my .tmux.conf (very customized and useful), session manager script (also super useful) and backup script (from tmux src code)



Bin:

* **bash_wrapper.py** - wrap bash scripts in python to enable colorized logging, controlled workflow, and some basic bash-python integration.  Works, but not too useful.
* **cssparser.py** - reformat css from web into readable version
* **markovchain.py** - sym link to markov project 
* **matching_utils.py**
* **md5_async.py** - asynchronous md5 sum against multiple files. 
* **multidb_query.py** - execute sql queries against two (remote) databases, merge results, and drop into ipython shell. Super useful!  
* **peekable.py** - make an iterator peekable (ie look ahead, but don't call next() )
* **sequencefactory.py** - Dynamic Inheritance in python! Given an object, return new object of same type with some additional methods.
* **tmux-sessions.sh** - sym link to tmux project
* **tmux_backup.sh** - sym link to tmux project
