    ...and the birthday problem...

    what's the chance that a pair of artists will NOT share the same
(50) line(s)?
    (ie. the days of the year = total number of users, and each user has
50 birthdays!)

    p(not a pair) = 1 * p(a2|a1) * p(a3|a1 and a2) * ...
                  = 1 * (n-freq_a1))/(n) * (n-(freq_a1+freq_a2))/(n)

        where n is number of lines of input data * 50
        and freq_aX = the number of lines that artist appeared on
            Note: Because we want the pairs that occurred 50 or more
times,
            I'm setting the denominator = to 50*n. I not sure whether
this is
            actually correct.

    And:

    p(pair) = 1 - p(not a pair)
